Line Following Robot
====================

## Description
Final Project for ME 433. A robot that follows a line using a camera. Pi Pico W read camera, detected the line, and send the line position to the PIC32MX170F256B. The PIC32MX170F256B then controls the motors to follow the line. 

I won the Kind of Cheating Award because instead of using the camera to detect the line I just controlled the Robot from my computer over wifi which connected
to the pico W.
